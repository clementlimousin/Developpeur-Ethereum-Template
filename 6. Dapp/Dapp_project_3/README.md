# Project 3: Voting application

## Access to Heruko server

The heruko server is not available at the moment. I had problems with github and I can't succeed on a remote server.

## Deploy in local


In a terminal, launch a local ganache instance
```
npm run ganache
```

In an another terminal, migrate and deploy on your local blockchain
```
truffle migrate
```

Configure your browser wallet with ganache available accounts and ganache local blockchain

In the client folder, deploy the frontend react application
```
npm run start
```
